        <h1>Climate change</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        Climate change, a multifaceted and pressing global issue, is reshaping our planet in profound ways. At its core,
        climate change refers to significant and lasting alterations in the average weather patterns over extended
        periods, ranging from decades to millions of years. The primary driver of recent climate change is human
        activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes that have
        led to an unprecedented increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

        The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide
        (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), trap heat from the sun. This trapped heat helps to maintain the
        Earth’s temperature at a level necessary to support life. However, human activities have significantly amplified
        this effect by increasing the concentrations of these greenhouse gases, leading to a more pronounced warming of
        the planet—commonly referred to as global warming.

        The consequences of climate change are extensive and diverse, impacting ecosystems, weather patterns, sea
        levels, and human societies. One of the most visible signs of climate change is the melting of polar ice caps
        and glaciers. This has contributed to rising sea levels, which pose a substantial threat to coastal regions
        worldwide. Low-lying areas, such as parts of Bangladesh and small island nations, are particularly vulnerable,
        facing the risk of displacement due to increased flooding and erosion.

        Furthermore, the warming of oceans has severe implications for marine life. Coral reefs, which are biodiversity
        hotspots, are experiencing widespread bleaching events due to higher sea temperatures. This not only affects
        marine species but also the millions of people who depend on these ecosystems for food and income. Altered ocean
        currents and temperatures can also disrupt fish populations, impacting global fisheries and food security.

        Climate change also exacerbates the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Hurricanes, droughts,
        heatwaves, and heavy rainfall are becoming more common and severe, causing immediate destruction and long-term
        socio-economic impacts. For instance, prolonged droughts can devastate agriculture, leading to food shortages
        and higher prices. Heatwaves pose serious health risks, particularly to the elderly and those with preexisting
        health conditions, while intense storms can cause significant damage to infrastructure and loss of life.

        Another critical aspect of climate change is its role in exacerbating social inequalities. Vulnerable
        populations, including those in developing countries and marginalized communities, are often the hardest hit.
        They typically have fewer resources to adapt to changing conditions, making them more susceptible to
        displacement, health problems, and economic hardships. This underscores the need for climate justice, ensuring
        that those who contribute the least to climate change do not bear the brunt of its impacts.

        Addressing climate change requires a comprehensive and coordinated global response. Mitigation strategies focus
        on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power,
        enhancing energy efficiency, and protecting forests, which act as carbon sinks. Transitioning to a low-carbon
        economy also involves changes in transportation, agriculture, and industry.
